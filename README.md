# Next-Gen TUI Email Client

A modern terminal-based email client built in Go that combines the efficiency of CLI tools with the polish of contemporary TUI applications.

## Features

- **Resource Efficient**: Lightweight alternative to memory-heavy webmail clients
- **Modern TUI**: Inspired by lazygit and neovim aesthetics with mouse + keyboard support
- **Conversation Threading**: Gmail-style email threading as first-class experience  
- **Powerful Search**: Telescope-style fuzzy search with live preview
- **Zero Config**: Auto-detects existing maildir setups from mbsync/offlineimap

## Architecture

Follows the aerc philosophy - delegates email sync/send to external tools (mbsync, msmtp, notmuch) and focuses on delivering an exceptional user experience.
